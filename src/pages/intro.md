## Start
This guide aims to pull together quality content about React core concepts into a central location for quick reference.

> **Tip:** 🤔 Learn React before you try using things like Redux, MobX.  See: [8 things to learn in React before using Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/) @rwieruch

Remember we're all learning.  Read, Try, Mess Up (it's okay).  If you find this guide helpful let me know [@timarney](https://twitter.com/timarney).


```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Learn React</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

>There's lots to learn but if you break it down there are some key concepts to focus on. JSX, React Elements, Components, Lifecycle Methods, Props and State.


> **Tip:** 🤔 If you're stuck checkout out [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactjs)

## These articles will start you down the path to learning React.
