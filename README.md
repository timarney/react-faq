* [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) Create React apps with no configuration (until you need it)
* [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) A minimalistic framework for universal server-rendered React applications
* [react-server](https://github.com/redfin/react-server) Batteries-included Server-rendered React applications. Note: also see [React 30 -> 002 - Streaming React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW_c60NCkI4)

#Why use React?

>
* Composable components
* Easy to use with existing projects
* Declarative
* Functional / Immutable friendly


**Is it fast?**
* [Is React.js fast? Faster than {framework}? … or are there more relevant questions to be asking?](https://medium.com/react-weekly/is-react-js-fast-faster-than-framework-or-are-there-more-relevant-questions-to-be-asking-bcf40211f89b#.ll2aubhbi) Jeff Barczewski @jeffbski

* [Design Principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html)

#JSX
**What's JSX?**

>JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. - http://buildwithreact.com

* [Tutorial: JSX](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/jsx)
* [JSX in Depth](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [React’s JSX: The Other Side of the Coin](https://medium.com/@housecor/react-s-jsx-the-other-side-of-the-coin-2ace7ab62b98#.i5rmd9h07) Cory House @housecor
* [What does JSX stand for?](https://twitter.com/tomocchino/status/769931611303321601) Tom Occhino @tomocchino

**What does JSX really do for me?**

#The Virtual DOM

>The Virtual DOM provides a lightweight implementation of the DOM and events system. Instead of dealing with the browser, you manipulate an in-memory version of the DOM.

**What is the Virtual DOM?**
* [React's diff algorithm](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/diff/) Christopher Chedeau @vjeux
* [The one thing that no one properly explains about React — Why Virtual DOM](https://hashnode.com/post/the-one-thing-that-no-one-properly-explains-about-react-why-virtual-dom-cisczhfj41bmssp53mvfwmgrq) Sai Kishore Komanduri @saiki
* [Pete Hunt: The Secrets of React's Virtual DOM (FutureJS 2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4)

**Is the Virtual DOM all about speed?**

*No*

See :

https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/790326092582252544
https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/779693791607336960

> I wonder if we can reclaim the VDOM term to mean "Value DOM", as in Value Type, instead of "Virtual DOM"...? More accurate. **@sebmarkbage**
<hr>
> It doesn't improve perf over hand written DOM code but it's hard to write on scale. React scales well. **@dan_abramov**
<hr>
> React ultimately has to call browser APIs at some point, it can't possibly be faster than writing the same exact calls by hand **@dan_abramov**
<hr>
>React will not do anything that you cannot. By definition everything it does can be reproduced (and some people have with other libraries/frameworks that follow similar conventions). The point is not that React does something that you can't, but rather that by introducing React to your application you are relieved of having to worry about manually handling your DOM, manually determining how to update it efficiently, minimizing traversals, etc. - [Sean Grogg](https://www.quora.com/Is-ReactJS-faster-than-direct-DOM-manipulation-with-JavaScript-or-jQuery)

**Key Takeaway:**

> React keeps your product reasonably fast without you having to think about it all the time, or to jump through the hoops **@dan_abramov**

#React elements
> Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
> Elements are what components are "made of ..."
— [React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

* [What makes an 'Element' an 'Element' vs a component?](https://twitter.com/timarney/status/790540834466701312) Tim Arney @timarney
* [Understanding the Difference Between React Elements and Components](https://quickleft.com/blog/understanding-the-difference-between-react-elements-and-components) Alex Johnson
* [React Elements vs React Components](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-elements-vs-react-components) Tyler McGinnis

#Components
> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. - [React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html)

**What are some of your best practices when working with components?**

> * Keep it (F)ocused.
* Keep it (I)ndependent.
* Keep it (R)eusable.
* Keep it (S)mall.
* Keep it (T)estable.
* or in short, `FIRST`.

> — Addy Osmani https://addyosmani.com/first

#Lifecycle Methods

>Components have several "lifecycle methods" that allow you to override / run code at particular times.

**What are Lifecycle Methods?**

#Component Types
> There are two main types of components Functional and Class Components

```
// Functional Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Class Component

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

Components can be used (composed) in many ways see the following links for patterns and thoughts on creating Components.

**How do I decide what type of Component to use?**

>This comes down to a few factors... a primary one being you need to decide what a component should do.  
See: [Some Thoughts on Function Components in React](https://medium.com/javascript-inside/some-thoughts-on-function-components-in-react-cb2938686bc7#.2oazdyli1) from A. Sharif @sharifsbeat for some help deciding.

#State

> In one sense, “state” means the current visual representation of the app on screen... In the React sense, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object called this.state. - Dave Ceddia

#Refs
>The ref attribute makes it possible to store a reference to a particular React element or component returned by the component render() configuration function.

#Controlled Components

**What is a controlled component?**

Via Loren Stewart @lorenstewart111 [React.js Forms: Controlled Components](http://lorenstewart.me/2016/10/31/react-js-forms-controlled-components)

>A controlled component has two aspects:

1. Controlled components have functions to govern the data going into them on every onChange event, rather than grabbing the data only once, e.g. when a user clicks a submit button. This 'governed' data is then saved to state (in this case, the parent/container component's state).

2. Data displayed by a controlled component is received through props passed down from it's parent/container component.

> This is a one-way loop – from (1) child component input (2) to parent component state and (3) back down to the child component via props – is what is meant by unidirectional data flow in React.js application architecture.

#CSS and React

* Watch this 🔥 💯 [Styling React.JS applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19gqsBc_Cx0) Max Stoiber @mxstbr

**What about styling things in React?**

You can use plain CSS or any preprocessor (Sass, Less etc...) with React.  React outputs standard markup so technically you can keep doing what you've been doing.

> Using CSS to style our React content is actually as straightforward as you can imagine it to be. Because React ends up spitting out regular HTML tags, all of the various CSS tricks you've learned over the years to style HTML still apply. -  kirupa
